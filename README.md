# Advanced-Quantitative-Marketing
Empirical quantitative marketing models for PhD level marketing or economics students. Models belows are estimated using a few basic operations: linear equation solution, matrix multiply,vector product, exponential and logarithm evaluation, and coordinate assignment. We will not going to details of optimizations, which will be provided by exsiting packages.

We will assume you have basic knowledge on discrete choice models, statistics and linear algebra. If you find parts unclear, please check the reference below.

- Latent segements Logit
- Random coefficient Logit
- BLP
- Learning models
- Dynamic programming
